# FHE Demo Project - Private Eligibility Checker

This is a beginner-level Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) project that simulates private grant eligibility checking. Users can input their income, and the app checks if they qualify without revealing the actual amount.

### 🔐 Goal:
To explore how FHE can protect user data and enable privacy-preserving logic in decentralized applications.

### 💻 Tech Stack:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (simulated FHE logic)
- [Future] Integration with Zama’s TFHE library

### 📦 Features:
- Simple UI for user input
- Simulated encrypted eligibility check
- Beginner-friendly code structure

### 🚀 Getting Started:
Just open `index.html` in your browser to run the project.
